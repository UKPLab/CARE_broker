Database
========

As a database we use `ArangoDB <https://www.arangodb.com>`_.
ArangoDB is a multi-model database with flexible data models for documents, graphs, and key-values.

In development mode the database can be accessed via the web interface at http://localhost:8529.

See https://docs.python-arango.com/en/main/ for more information on how to use the Python driver.
